## Off the cuff

I've been building this website for several reasons.  

One is that, given the amount of time I put into writing for myself, I have become a proficient communicator via text.
Which isn't to say my writing is of much or any value as of yet (which also isn't to say that it's not), but I feel that
it would be worth my time to start outputting my writing in a form that is digestable to more than just myself.  

I've managed to mitigate the voice of judgement in my own head. Such is not the cause of others' judging my work
but from myself judging my own work through the imagined voices of others. Now, even though I will be putting my work somewhere
where others can see it, I can still write un-phased by judgement because it's a mental mechanism rather than a fear of potential
misunderstanding.
