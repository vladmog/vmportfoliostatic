title: "Why You Shouldn't Hire Me."

Hello, my name is Vladislav Mogilevskiy. During the time of this writing I am actively searching for a job. Given the nature of the industry I am applying for, I am expecting employers to be looking over my portfolio website. This is, of course, to quantify my technical ability as well as to get a sense of who I am as a person. I also understand that evaluating someone for their "culture fit" is as hard, if not harder, than evaluating someone's skill. With this in mind, I have taken the liberty of making that process a simple one by compiling all the reasons one might be better off hiring someone else.  

## If you are strictly looking for a remote worker

I have worked with and led teams in both remote and on-site conditions. Both went well and both have their benefits. After experiencing both, however, it is clear to me that I am of much greater benefit to a team when I can work with people in person. Software is built through code, solid code requires solid planning, and solid planning requires a solid team. Communication is foundational in building team dynamics and while I am confident in my abilities to communicate via messages and video conferences, my full potential remains limited when restricted to such means alone. I thrive in conditions where I can contribute to the limits of my ability. As such, I am not interested in working from home at this point of my career.  

## If my qualifications are all that are expected of me

I have learned much, but of all the things I've learned, it is learning itself that I have gained the most proficiency in and hunger for. As such, I am eager to learn new technologies and expand both my technical and professional skillsets. While I aim to further strengthen my existing abilities over the course of my career, my greater goal is to build on those capabilities and grow as a professional. If you could benefit from an individual who demonstrates such efforts then our goals are in alignment.  

## If I wouldn't be a part of discussions

I'm at a stage in my professional development where I feel confident in my ability to make decisions on behalf of a group, but lack enough history to expect the same faith from others. I would like to be involved in decision making discussions to listen and learn. I would also like to be involved because I feel I can add a valuable voice to the process, but I can't back that up yet so I'll put that second. Regardless, if such conversations are held in group settings, I'm able to provide greater value as opposed to a system where all such conversations are held behind closed doors.
