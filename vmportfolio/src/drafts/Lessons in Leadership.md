## Outline

- The energy I put into the project influenced the outcome.

  - My energy influences the team to relax their nerves
    - Be patient but keep moving forward
    - firm yet easygoing
    - playful yet focused
  - My team in turn builds greater connections with one another
  - A team that communicates more executes on solutions more efficiently

- I did not let the outcome of the project influence my energy.

  - The state of progress can fluctuate greatly, and you cannot let those fluctuations be reflected in your morale

  - Never get discouraged by failure, it brings everyone down and it doesn't move the mission forward.

    - When things don't go according to plan, the first thing I do is evaluate the situation and look for a valid alternative.

  - Similarly, don't relax when great strides are achieved. Salute the team and give congratulations when deserved, but don't let successes be an excuse to relax. Keep moving.

* I didn't multi-task

  - Multi-tasking makes for sloppy work, and when dealing with people, disenables you from being able to fully absorb what the person is saying and can come across as disrespectful.
  - ex: don't read/write email while in meetings, pay full attention.
    - It came across as disrespectful and unprofessional to me seeing others in meetings reading emails or laughing at something else
    - It prevents you from fully absorbing what is said and shows a lack of priority.
  - ex: attack a problem at a time and give it your full attention
    - Remote work taught the necessity of focus because the rest of the world is essentially available at your finger tips at any given time.

* I planned so multiple things are being accomplished at all times.

  - (DEPRECATED) While multi-tasking is disadvantageous for an individual, a team of individuals has the capacity to attack multiple problems at the same time. Taking this into consideration when planning how a team is to attack a problem over time is crucial to efficiency.
  - Identify how many people a task can most efficiently be accomplished with. Compare this to the total amount of team members and their capabilities.
    - I first tried leading a group to solve problems the same way I solve problems. Mob programming turned out to be inefficient. Had to find another way
  - Be aware of dependencies. What tasks require other tasks to be completed prior to beginning the original task? Take this into consideration

- I always had a plan.
- Leadership is more than showing up and telling people what to do.
  - At one point I felt ill equipped to lead the team.
  - Took a step back to think and realized that the issue was that I didn't understand the problem.
  - Need to understand the fundamental problem and what needs to be accomplished at any given time to make progress to solving the problem.
  - Take time away from the team to evaluate the current state of things at different angles to identify where focus is required.
- I was always prepared to improvise.

  - When things don't go according to plan (and they will), one must be prepared to improvise on the spot.

- Evaluate the goal. Identify why the initial plan didn't work. Identify feasible alternatives to the original plan. Execute upon an alternative with an appropriate balance of speed, and quality.

*

## Get critical

Will this be useful to the reader?

- For the hiring manager:
  - Yes. It shows that I'm a good human being and a hard worker that is conscious of his betterment.
  - No. It doesn't reference the project that I gained these experiences from. Mention this in the introduction to alleviate this.
- For people finding me on social media:
  - Yes. It gives them a sense of my character and perhaps teaches them something for their own benefit
- For my future children:
  - Yes. If I write this in a light hearted enough tone, it will make them see me for who I was in the given moment (because this undertaking was taken rather lightheartedly)
  - Yes. Offers them practical guidance to being leaders themselves. Will be less afraid to take charge of situations rather than looking for external guidance.

Will this be great or just okay?

- This is great. These insights aren't common knowledge. They are actionable. They will yield immediate results upon implementation.

Is it meaningful?

- Yes. It will directly affect people's day to day lives even if they are not leaders.

Will people still have questions after reading the article?

- Perhaps hiring managers will still have questions as to how I learned these lessons as the experiential aspect of learning is as, if not more important than the lessons themselves from a hiring perspective. Perhaps include anecdotes as to how you gained these insights. After all, this is a blog post about a first timer's experience of leadership. First timers make mistakes. Showing those mistakes makes this post more believable, more personable, and more digestible.

## Introduction to "How I survived leading my first AGILE team"

I had always found myself in leadership roles when placed into team environments. In hindsight I believe this was probably just coincidental. Regardless, because of this pattern, I'd figured it would naturally be easy for me to take on a leadership role. So I applied for an AGILE team lead position. I was accepted and next thing I knew, I was leading a team comprised of five web developers and two data scientists. For the first time, by default, everyone around me was looking to me for direction. I thought it would be easy. You might've guessed: it wasn't easy.

All in all, though, I didn't fail my team. We overcame what others thought to be impossible problems given our deadline and we developed lasting friendships along the way. This isn't to say that I had things figured out from the start. I just knew I had to figure things out quickly. Once I'd done so (as best I could), it became easier to maintain a balance and rhythm that built momentum in the team. As such, without further adieu, this post is my attempt to outline what I did to survive as a leader going through my trial by fire. I've barely begun making sense of what it takes to lead effectively, however I do believe anyone could benefit from adopting these habits, whether they're leading a team or not.+



### PROOFREAD Introduction

I had always found myself in leadership roles when placed into teams. Because of this, I thought it would be easy for me to take on a leadership role, so I applied for a position leading an AGILE team. I was accepted and next thing I knew, I was leading a team of five web developers and two data scientists to build an intelligent email client. For the first time, by default, everyone around me was looking to me for direction. I thought it would be easy. I think you might know where this is going.

All in all, I didn't fail my team. We overcame what others thought to be impossible problems given our deadlines and we developed lasting friendships along the way. This isn't to say that I had things figured out. I just knew I had to figure things out quickly. Once I'd done so (as best I could), it became easier to maintain a balance and rhythm that built momentum in the team. This post is my attempt to outline what I did to survive as a leader going through my trial by fire. I've barely begun making sense of what it takes to lead effectively, however I do believe anyone could benefit from my early realizations, whether they're leading a team or not.

## I used my enthusiasm to influence the outcome of the project

I believe the most important aspect a team could have to be successful is a solid team dynamic.

The most common obstacles to building a good team dynamic, in my experience, have been shyness, fear of looking foolish, and lack of motivation in the team.

I was shy growing up but I literally forced myself into social situations to learn how to not be shy. This actually did work, but I also noticed what others did that made me feel comfortable in new groups and I applied this to helping shy team members.

Asking the team odd or funny questions to get them to talk about themselves gives those that are shy a rare opportunity to receive positive feedback from people they don't know. Doing this regularly early on makes for an environment where everyone feels open to express their thoughts.

In regards to team members who stay quiet out of fear of coming across as foolish, responding to mistakes as opportunities to learn and even being willing to be wrong as the leader relieves others of the shame of looking bad for asking what they may think to be dumb questions.

Finally this leaves those that lack motivation. How do you get everyone to be excited about a project? To be fair, you can't. What seems clear enough to me though is that a team is unlikely to be motivated to attack a problem that the leader doesn't feel strongly about. As such, if you can see the value in your efforts and you radiate that enthusiasm, your team will be more likely to feel their own efforts are making a difference,

Taking this experience back to working with new teams, I've found certain things work particularly well for building group dynamics. For example, giving team members a reason to express themselves allows those that are shy the rare experience of receiving positive feedback from people they don't know.



### PROOFREAD I  used my enthusiasm to influence the outcome of the project

I believe the most important aspect of a team is its dynamic.

The biggest blockers in building a good team dynamic, in my experience, have been shyness, fear of looking foolish, and lack of motivation in the team.

When it comes to shy team mates, I've found that occasionally asking the team non-work related questions gives those that are shy a rare opportunity to receive positive feedback from people they don't know. Doing this regularly early on makes for an environment where everyone feels open to express their thoughts.

In regards to team members who stay quiet out of fear of coming across as foolish, responding to mistakes as opportunities to learn and even being willing to be wrong as the leader relieves others of the shame of looking bad.

Finally this leaves those that lack motivation. How do you get everyone to be excited about a project? To be fair, you can't. What's become obvious to me though is that a team is highly unlikely to be motivated when the leader isn't motivated themselves. As such, if you can see the value in your efforts and radiate that enthusiasm, your team will be more likely to feel their own efforts are making a difference.



## I did not let the outcome of the project influence my enthusiasm

The state of a project can fluctuate greatly, Somedays things can be moving along so smoothly that it sets you ahead of schedule. Other times it may seem that so many things are going wrong that deadlines begin to feel impossible to meet.

Regardless of how things have gone, I have always kept the same attitude and approach to leading. If things are breaking left and right, there is work to be done. If great progress has been made, perhaps some congratulations are in order, but still, there is yet work to be done.

It's almost a given that something will go wrong over the course of a project. As such, it makes no sense to get upset when it does. This only serves to bring down the morale of the team, and allowing that to happen can be even more devastating than the problem at hand. Rather than adding to the weight of existing problems, I've always framed each obstacle as a new opportunity for the team to learn and demonstrate their ability to adapt.

Similarly, allowing great successes to be seen as a reason to relax and slow down can negate those very successes. Any surplus of momentum is precious and the only way to reap the benefits of it are to maintain it. The time to celebrate is when the mission has been accomplished. Until then, celebrating successes early puts the team at risk of falling back to baseline progress, if not behind schedule.

## I didn't multitask

Multitasking is often flexed as a positive quality. Some companies say that they seek, and individuals claim that they are,  someone who is able to multitask at all times with great efficiency. I don't subscribe to this mentality. In my experience, the most efficient way to work is to focus on a task at a time so as to give it full attention. When you focus your mind on two different things, you're only able to give 50% of your attention to each of the things. Increase the amount of things being focused on and that percentage only goes down. 

During meetings I never browsed the internet or checked my emails unless it was for the purposes of the meeting. In remote environments this is a particular issue because the entire world is essentially at one's fingertips. It's all too often that I see others distracted laughing at something on the internet only to become flustered when they're asked to discuss the subject they'd failed to hear.

In regards to tasks, I always maintained a plan so that I could get multiple tasks done while only having to focus on one at a time. Switching between tasks when certain processes allow you time to step away and focus on something else is different than multitasking because you can still fully commit yourself to the task at hand. Being able to foresee these opportunities and plan with them in mind is crucial to efficiency. 

But how do I get things done as a leader with this mentality? Well...

### PROOFREAD I didn't multitask

Multitasking is often talked about positively. I don't subscribe to this mentality. In my experience, the most efficient way to work is to focus on a task at a time so as to give it your full attention. When you focus your mind on two different tasks, you're only able to give 50% of your attention to each task. The more tasks you try to juggle, the smaller that number becomes.

I found this especially important to keep in mind working in a remote environment. The ability to focus is tested when the nature of your work has you plugged into the internet all day, and there's no one place where this is tested more than in video conferences. I never browsed the internet or checked my emails during meetings unless it was for the purposes of the meeting. Focusing in this regard ensures key information isn't overheard, and even more importantly, maintains the team's respect. Failing to do so risks limiting the potential of any team.

In regards to tasks, I maintained a plan so that I accomplish multiple tasks while only having to focus on one at a time. Seeing windows in time that allow you to step away and focus on something else is essential to efficiency. This is different from multitasking because you can still fully commit yourself to the task at hand. Making a constant effort to foresee these opportunities and plan with them in mind is necessary for a team to reach its full potential. 

But how do I get things done as a leader with this mentality? Well...



## I planned so multiple things are being accomplished at all times

When leading a team, multiples things can be accomplished concurrently because multiple minds can focus on multiple tasks. 

The first time I led an AGILE team, I tried leading the team of seven to solve problems the same way I do as an individual: one at a time. The issue with this became apparent when only 1-2 people were actively working on the problem while the rest sat back and watched. I realized that having many people attack a problem doesn't speed up how fast that task would get accomplished.

What I did then was I created a list of immediately attackable problems. Next to each problem I wrote the minimum amount of people each task might require to accomplish quickly. Then I allocated tasks to individuals best able to solve each particular task. Doing this allowed the team to make progress at its full potential. The benefit was so clear, I made that process a daily part of my plan. 

Oh yeah, about that...

## I always had a plan

The first thing I learned as a team lead is that in order to give direction to a team, I must first understand the problem at hand. This may come as obvious but what's less obvious is that achieving a problem typically entails solving various sub-problems. As more sub-problems are chipped away at, the immediate problems at hand evolve over time. Therefore, understanding a problem is a sustained effort that requires regular attention, not just a single evaluation.

There were times when I felt ill equipped to lead the team on our mission. Looking back, most of those bouts with imposter syndrome were due to me not having understood the state of the problem at the particular stage of its evolution. It simply took a moment of panic followed by some time re-evaluating the problem and the current state of things to realize what action needed to be taken to keep things moving forward.

I did want to cut out any needless moments of panic from that process. What worked for me has been to dedicate time everyday to evaluate the current state of the project and the sub-problems at hand to come up with a daily plan of attack. This way, priorities could be maintained and kept dynamic to the changing needs of the project.

## I was always prepared to improvise

Things in life don't always go according to plan however. Leading a software engineering team is no different. While a good plan and daily reflection can greatly reduce the risk of things going off the rails, things do usually go wrong in some way. When they do, all eyes are on you and, you need to make a call. But how? How do you give direction when you're as lost as anyone else?

A month into developing a legacy codebase that was passed down to us by a prior team, my team and I realized that the foundational tech of the product would require a +\$10,000 audit in order to prevent legal issues. This was not an option and neither was just substituting the technology as the whole codebase was built around the technology. What this meant for us is that three months of work needed to be scrapped, rearchitected, rebuilt, and further built upon in 1/3 the amount of time it took to build in the first place.

Long story short, we improvised and we succeeded. Not only did we rebuild the project better than we received it, we also managed to ship the additional deliverables we'd originally planned. Here's how we did it and how you too can approach unforeseen circumstances:

1. Relax

   Take a deep breath. This is just another problem like any other. The only difference is you didn't see this one coming. While investing yourself into a plan only to have it flipped on its head can be frustrating, that frustration will only make it more difficult to think clearly and come up with a new plan.

2. Re-evaluate the problem

   The immediate issues may be clear, but it's important to look at things from all angles to gain a full understanding of a problem before devising a plan of attack. The last thing you want to do is implement a solution that causes more problems than it solves.

3) Identify alternatives
   Get creative here. Make a list and have discussions. Sometimes a "dumb" solution is the best solution. Sometimes given certain constraints, there will be no such thing as a "perfect solution". When this is the case, every alternative will be a compromise and you will need to weigh the long-term costs and benefits of each.

4. Execute

   Once nerves have settled, the problem is re-evaluated, and an alternative is settled on, waste no time in execution. Plan your attack, allocate responsibilities, and get moving.

---

In summary, I managed to survive and excel as a leader by focusing on the team itself and constantly evaluating the situation to best plan how to approach problems as a unit. To further simplify how to survive as a leader, I can put it this way: be present. By being aware of the state of the project and the team members themselves, the immediate tasks that require attention make themselves known. This goes for leading teams as much as it goes for daily life.

I hope my experiences and principles prove helpful and help you go out and lead others to do something great.
